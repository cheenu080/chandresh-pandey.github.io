### 1. Handwritten Digits Classification (Python)
[Github](https://github.com/chinu-2000/mini-projects/blob/main/%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classification/%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classification.ipynb)

- The Handwritten Digits Classification project aims to classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using neural networks.
- The code uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a simple neural network with an input layer of 784 elements and an output layer of 10 elements.
- The input images are flattened into a single column containing 784 elements to be fed as input to the neural network.
- The model is trained on the MNIST dataset with 60,000 images of 28x28 pixels for five epochs and achieves an accuracy of 92.55%.
- Finally, the model is evaluated on the test dataset with 10,000 images and achieves an accuracy of 97.73%.

### 2. Home Price Deduction
[Github](https://github.com/chinu-2000/mini-projects/blob/main/Home%20Price%20Deduction/Home%20Price%20Deduction.ipynb)

- This Python code utilizes pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to perform linear regression for predicting home prices based on their areas. It trains a model on the data from ``homeprices.csv``, visualizes it, and predicts prices for new areas from ``areas.csv``.

### 3. Canada per-capita-income
[Github](https://github.com/chinu-2000/mini-projects/blob/main/canada_per_capita_income/percapita.ipynb)

- Conducted linear regression analysis on Canada's per capita income data from 1970 to 2017 using pandas, numpy, and sklearn libraries.
- Predicted per capita income for the year 2020 using the linear regression model and manually calculated the same using the formula ``y = mx + b``.Visualized the data and model predictions using matplotlib.
