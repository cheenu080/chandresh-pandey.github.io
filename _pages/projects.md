<h2> Projects </h2>

### 1.  PyTorch Transformer
[PyTorch]<br>
- Implemented the Transformer model from the Attention Is All You Need paper by Vaswani et al. using PyTorch.
- Applied the Transformer model to various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and sentiment analysis.

### 2. PDF-Synopsis Generator
[Python, Flask, HuggingFace]<br>
- SummarizeMaster is an AI-powered application designed to simplify reading by extracting concise summaries from PDF books.
- It utilizes advanced models BART to provide insightful book summaries efficiently.

### 3. Lung cancer prediction using Image-Segmentation, Equalization and Transfer learning
[Tensorflow, OpenCV, Seaborn]<br>
- Implemented an automatic lung cancer detection system using deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and reduce diagnosis time.
- Employed image processing methods, including Histogram Equalization and Threshold Segmentation, to preprocess CT scan images for better
contrast and segmentation.
- Developed and trained various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet,
ResNet50, Xception, and InceptionV3, for lung cancer prediction,
