<h2> Projects </h2>

### 1.  Handwritten Digits Classification (Python, Numpy)
FEB 20 - FEB 22, [Github](https://github.com/chinu-2000/AI-ML/blob/main/%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classification/%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classification.ipynb)

-  The Handwritten Digits Classification project aims to classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using neural networks.
-  The code uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a simple neural network with an input layer of 784 elements and an output layer of 10 elements.
-  The input images are flattened into a single column containing 784 elements to be fed as input to the neural network.
-  The model is trained on the MNIST dataset with 60,000 images of 28x28 pixels for five epochs and achieves an accuracy of 92.55%.
-  Finally, the model is evaluated on the test dataset with 10,000 images and achieves an accuracy of 97.73%.


### 2. Home Price Deduction (Python, Numpy )

FEB 23, [Github](https://github.com/chinu-2000/AI-ML/blob/main/Home%20Price%20Deduction/Home%20Price%20Deduction.ipynb)

- Used Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, to perform linear regression on a dataset of home prices.
- Plotted a scatter graph to visualize the relationship between the area of a house and its price.
- Trained a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its area using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
- Used the trained model to predict the price of a house with an area of 3300 sq. ft. and found it to be 628,715.75 US dollars.
